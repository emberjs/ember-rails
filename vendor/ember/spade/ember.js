It helps to instantiate, initialize and coordinate the many\n  objects that make up your app.\n\n  Each Ember.js app has one and only one `Ember.Application` object. In fact, the very\n  first thing you should do in your application is create the instance:\n\n  ```javascript\n  window.App = Ember.Application.create();\n  ```\n\n  Typically, the application object is the only global variable. All other\n  classes in your app should be properties on the `Ember.Application` instance,\n  which highlights its first role: a global namespace.\n\n  For example, if you define a view class, it might look like this:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.MyView = Ember.View.extend();\n  ```\n\n  After all of your classes are defined, call `App.initialize()` to start the\n  application.\n\n  Because `Ember.Application` inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes\n  you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`;\n  see the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.\n\n  While you can think of your `Ember.Application` as a container that holds the\n  other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities\n  going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand.\n\n  ### Event Delegation\n\n  Ember.js uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework\n  to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to do\n  it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own `mousedown`\n  listener on its associated element, Ember.js sets up a `mousedown` listener on\n  the `body`.\n\n  If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember.js will look at the target of the event and\n  start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking their\n  `mouseDown` method as it goes.\n\n  `Ember.Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as well\n  as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For\n  example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be\n  called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.\n\n  If there is a browser event that Ember.js does not listen for by default, you\n  can specify custom events and their corresponding view method names by setting\n  the application's `customEvents` property:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App = Ember.Application.create({\n    customEvents: {\n      // add support for the loadedmetadata media\n      // player event\n      'loadedmetadata': \"loadedMetadata\"\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document body.\n  However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember.js application inside an\n  existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element inside\n  the body.\n\n  For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app` should\n  be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:\n\n  ```javascript\n  window.App = Ember.Application.create({\n    rootElement: '#ember-app'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector\n  string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will not\n  receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only append\n  views inside it!\n\n  To learn more about the advantages of event delegation and the Ember.js view layer,\n  and a list of the event listeners that are setup by default, visit the\n  [Ember.js View Layer guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/view_layer#toc_event-delegation).\n\n  ### Dependency Injection\n\n  One thing you may have noticed while using Ember.js is that you define *classes*, not\n  *instances*. When your application loads, all of the instances are created for you.\n  Creating these instances is the responsibility of `Ember.Application`.\n\n  When the `Ember.Application` initializes, it will look for an `Ember.Router` class\n  defined on the applications's `Router` property, like this:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.Router = Ember.Router.extend({\n  // ...\n  });\n  ```\n\n  If found, the router is instantiated and saved on the application's `router`\n  property (note the lowercase 'r'). While you should *not* reference this router\n  instance directly from your application code, having access to `App.router`\n  from the console can be useful during debugging.\n\n  After the router is created, the application loops through all of the\n  registered _injections_ and invokes them once for each property on the\n  `Ember.Application` object.\n\n  An injection is a function that is responsible for instantiating objects from\n  classes defined on the application. By default, the only injection registered\n  instantiates controllers and makes them available on the router.\n\n  For example, if you define a controller class:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.MyController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n    // ...\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Your router will receive an instance of `App.MyController` saved on its\n  `myController` property.\n\n  Libraries on top of Ember.js can register additional injections. For example,\n  if your application is using Ember Data, it registers an injection that\n  instantiates `DS.Store`:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Ember.Application.registerInjection({\n    name: 'store',\n    before: 'controllers',\n\n    injection: function(app, router, property) {\n      if (property === 'Store') {\n        set(router, 'store', app[property].create());\n      }\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ### Routing\n\n  In addition to creating your application's router, `Ember.Application` is also\n  responsible for telling the router when to start routing.\n\n  By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into\n  application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you\n  need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()` method.\n  Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.\n\n  If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a `ready()`\n  method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing begins:\n\n  ```javascript\n  window.App = Ember.Application.create({\n    ready: function() {\n      this.set('router.enableLogging', true);\n    }\n  });\n\n  To begin routing, you must have at a minimum a top-level controller and view.\n  You define these as `App.ApplicationController` and `App.ApplicationView`,\n  respectively. Your application will not work if you do not define these two\n  mandatory classes. For example:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.ApplicationView = Ember.View.extend({\n    templateName: 'application'\n  });\n  App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend();\n  ```\n\n  @class Application\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.Namespace\n*/\nEmber.Application = Ember.Namespace.extend(\n/** @scope Ember.Application.prototype */{\n\n  /**\n    The root DOM element of the Application. This can be specified as an\n    element or a\n    [jQuery-compatible selector string](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/).\n\n    This is the element that will be passed to the Application's,\n    `eventDispatcher`, which sets up the listeners for event delegation.

The\n  underlying data object of the selected `<option>` is stored in the\n  Element.Select's `value` property.\n\n  ### `content` as an array of Strings\n  The simplest version of an Ember.Select takes an array of strings as its `content` property.\n  The string will be used as both the `value` property and the inner text of each `<option>`\n  element inside the rendered `<select>`.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  App.names = [\"Yehuda\", \"Tom\"];\n  ```\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select contentBinding=\"App.names\"}}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML:\n\n  ``` html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option value=\"Yehuda\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"Tom\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n  You can control which `<option>` is selected through the Ember.Select's\n  `value` property directly or as a binding:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  App.names = Ember.Object.create({\n    selected: 'Tom',\n    content: [\"Yehuda\", \"Tom\"]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select\n         contentBinding=\"App.names.content\"\n         valueBinding=\"App.names.selected\"\n  }}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML with the `<option>` for 'Tom' selected:\n\n  ``` html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option value=\"Yehuda\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"Tom\" selected=\"selected\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n  A user interacting with the rendered `<select>` to choose \"Yehuda\" would update\n  the value of `App.names.selected` to \"Yehuda\".\n\n  ### `content` as an Array of Objects\n  An Ember.Select can also take an array of JavaScript or Ember objects\n  as its `content` property.\n\n  When using objects you need to tell the Ember.Select which property should be\n  accessed on each object to supply the `value` attribute of the `<option>`\n  and which property should be used to supply the element text.\n\n  The `optionValuePath` option is used to specify the path on each object to\n  the desired property for the `value` attribute.  The `optionLabelPath` \n  specifies the path on each object to the desired property for the \n  element's text. Both paths must reference each object itself as 'content':\n\n  ``` javascript\n  App.programmers = [\n      Ember.Object.create({firstName: \"Yehuda\", id: 1}),\n      Ember.Object.create({firstName: \"Tom\",    id: 2})\n    ];\n  ```\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select\n         contentBinding=\"App.programmers\"\n         optionValuePath=\"content.id\"\n         optionLabelPath=\"content.firstName\"}}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML:\n\n  ``` html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option value>Please Select</option>\n    <option value=\"1\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"2\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n\n  The `value` attribute of the selected `<option>` within an Ember.Select\n  can be bound to a property on another object by providing a\n  `valueBinding` option:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  App.programmers = [\n      Ember.Object.create({firstName: \"Yehuda\", id: 1}),\n      Ember.Object.create({firstName: \"Tom\",    id: 2})\n    ];\n\n  App.currentProgrammer = Ember.Object.create({\n    id: 2\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select\n         contentBinding=\"App.programmers\"\n         optionValuePath=\"content.id\"\n         optionLabelPath=\"content.firstName\"\n         valueBinding=\"App.currentProgrammer.id\"}}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML with a selected option:\n\n  ``` html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option value>Please Select</option>\n    <option value=\"1\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"2\" selected=\"selected\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n  Interacting with the rendered element by selecting the first option\n  ('Yehuda') will update the `id` value of `App.currentProgrammer`\n  to match the `value` property of the newly selected `<option>`.\n\n  Alternatively, you can control selection through the underlying objects\n  used to render each object providing a `selectionBinding`. When the selected\n  `<option>` is changed, the property path provided to `selectionBinding`\n  will be updated to match the content object of the rendered `<option>`\n  element: \n\n  ``` javascript\n  App.controller = Ember.Object.create({\n    selectedPerson: null,\n    content: [\n      Ember.Object.create({firstName: \"Yehuda\", id: 1}),\n      Ember.Object.create({firstName: \"Tom\",    id: 2})\n    ]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select\n         contentBinding=\"App.controller.content\"\n         optionValuePath=\"content.id\"\n         optionLabelPath=\"content.firstName\"\n         selectionBinding=\"App.controller.selectedPerson\"}}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML with a selected option:\n\n  ``` html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option value>Please Select</option>\n    <option value=\"1\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"2\" selected=\"selected\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n\n  Interacting with the rendered element by selecting the first option\n  ('Yehuda') will update the `selectedPerson` value of `App.controller`\n  to match the content object of the newly selected `<option>`. In this\n  case it is the first object in the `App.content.content` \n\n  ### Supplying a Prompt\n\n  A `null` value for the Ember.Select's `value` or `selection` property\n  results in there being no `<option>` with a `selected` attribute:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  App.controller = Ember.Object.create({\n    selected: null,\n    content: [\n      \"Yehuda\",\n      \"Tom\"\n    ]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select\n         contentBinding=\"App.controller.content\"\n         valueBinding=\"App.controller.selected\"\n  }}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML:\n\n  ``` html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option value=\"Yehuda\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"Tom\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n  Although `App.controller.selected` is `null` and no `<option>`\n  has a `selected` attribute the rendered HTML will display the\n  first item as though it were selected. You can supply a string\n  value for the Ember.Select to display when there is no selection\n  with the `prompt` option:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  App.controller = Ember.Object.create({\n    selected: null,\n    content: [\n      \"Yehuda\",\n      \"Tom\"\n    ]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select\n         contentBinding=\"App.controller.content\"\n         valueBinding=\"App.controller.selected\"\n         prompt=\"Please select a name\"\n  }}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML:\n\n  ``` html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option>Please select a name</option>\n    <option value=\"Yehuda\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"Tom\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n  @class Select\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.View\n*/\nEmber.Select = Ember.View.extend(\n  /** @scope Ember.Select.prototype */ {\n\n  tagName: 'select',\n  classNames: ['ember-select'],\n  defaultTemplate: Ember.Handlebars.compile('{{#if view.prompt}}<option value>{{view.prompt}}</option>{{/if}}{{#each view.content}}{{view Ember.SelectOption contentBinding=\"this\"}}{{/each}}'),\n  attributeBindings: ['multiple', 'disabled', 'tabindex'],\n\n  /**\n    The `multiple` attribute of the select element.

By default the\n  `controller.target` is set to the Application's router.\n\n  User interaction with that element will invoke the supplied action name on\n  the appropriate target.\n\n  Given the following Handlebars template on the page\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type=\"text/x-handlebars\" data-template-name='a-template'>\n    <div {{action anActionName target=\"view\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  And application code\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    templateName: 'a-template',\n    anActionName: function(event){}\n  });\n\n  aView = AView.create();\n  aView.appendTo('body');\n  ```\n\n  Will results in the following rendered HTML\n\n  ``` html\n  <div class=\"ember-view\">\n    <div data-ember-action=\"1\">\n      click me\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  Clicking \"click me\" will trigger the `anActionName` method of the `aView`\n  object with a  `jQuery.Event` object as its argument. The `jQuery.Event`\n  object will be extended to include a `view` property that is set to the\n  original view interacted with (in this case the `aView` object).\n\n  ### Event Propagation\n\n  Events triggered through the action helper will automatically have\n  `.preventDefault()` called on them. You do not need to do so in your event\n  handlers. To stop propagation of the event, simply return `false` from your\n  handler.\n\n  If you need the default handler to trigger you should either register your\n  own event handler, or use event methods on your view class. See Ember.View\n  'Responding to Browser Events' for more information.\n\n  ### Specifying DOM event type\n\n  By default the `{{action}}` helper registers for DOM `click` events. You can\n  supply an `on` option to the helper to specify a different DOM event name:\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type=\"text/x-handlebars\" data-template-name='a-template'>\n    <div {{action anActionName on=\"doubleClick\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  See Ember.View 'Responding to Browser Events' for a list of\n  acceptable DOM event names.\n\n  Because `{{action}}` depends on Ember's event dispatch system it will only\n  function if an `Ember.EventDispatcher` instance is available. An\n  `Ember.EventDispatcher` instance will be created when a new\n  `Ember.Application` is created. Having an instance of `Ember.Application`\n  will satisfy this requirement.\n\n\n  ### Specifying a Target\n\n  There are several possible target objects for `{{action}}` helpers:\n\n  In a typical `Ember.Router`-backed Application where views are managed\n  through use of the `{{outlet}}` helper, actions will be forwarded to the\n  current state of the Applications's Router. See Ember.Router 'Responding\n  to User-initiated Events' for more information.\n\n  If you manually set the `target` property on the controller of a template's\n  `Ember.View` instance, the specifed `controller.target` will become the target\n  for any actions. Likely custom values for a controller's `target` are the\n  controller itself or a StateManager other than the Application's Router.\n\n  If the templates's view lacks a controller property the view itself is the target.\n\n  Finally, a `target` option can be provided to the helper to change which object\n  will receive the method call. This option must be a string representing a\n  path to an object:\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type=\"text/x-handlebars\" data-template-name='a-template'>\n    <div {{action anActionName target=\"MyApplication.someObject\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  Clicking \"click me\" in the rendered HTML of the above template will trigger\n  the  `anActionName` method of the object at `MyApplication.someObject`.\n  The first argument to this method will be a `jQuery.Event` extended to\n  include a `view` property that is set to the original view interacted with.\n\n  A path relative to the template's `Ember.View` instance can also be used as\n  a target:\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type=\"text/x-handlebars\" data-template-name='a-template'>\n    <div {{action anActionName target=\"parentView\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  Clicking \"click me\" in the rendered HTML of the above template will trigger\n  the `anActionName` method of the view's parent view.\n\n  The `{{action}}` helper is `Ember.StateManager` aware. If the target of the\n  action is an `Ember.StateManager` instance `{{action}}` will use the `send`\n  functionality of StateManagers. The documentation for `Ember.StateManager`\n  has additional information about this use.\n\n  If an action's target does not implement a method that matches the supplied\n  action name an error will be thrown.\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type=\"text/x-handlebars\" data-template-name='a-template'>\n    <div {{action aMethodNameThatIsMissing}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  With the following application code\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    templateName; 'a-template',\n    // note: no method 'aMethodNameThatIsMissing'\n    anActionName: function(event){}\n  });\n\n  aView = AView.create();\n  aView.appendTo('body');\n  ```\n\n  Will throw `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'call' of undefined` when\n  \"click me\" is clicked.\n\n  ### Specifying a context\n\n  You may optionally specify objects to pass as contexts to the `{{action}}` helper\n  by providing property paths as the subsequent parameters. These objects are made\n  available as the `contexts` (also `context` if there is only one) properties in the\n  `jQuery.Event` object:\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type=\"text/x-handlebars\" data-template-name='a-template'>\n    {{#each person in people}}\n      <div {{action edit person}}>\n        click me\n      </div>\n    {{/each}}\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  Clicking \"click me\" will trigger the `edit` method of the view's context with a\n  `jQuery.Event` object containing the person object as its context.\n\n  @method action\n  @for Ember.Handlebars.helpers\n  @param {String} actionName\n  @param {Object...} contexts\n  @param {Hash} options\n*/\nEmberHandlebars.registerHelper('action', function(actionName) {\n  var options = arguments[arguments.length - 1],\n      contexts = a_slice.call(arguments, 1, -1);\n\n  var hash = options.hash,\n      view = options.data.view,\n      target, controller, link;\n\n  // create a hash to pass along to registerAction\n  var action = {\n    eventName: hash.on || \"click\"\n  };\n\n  action.view = view = get(view, 'concreteView');\n\n  if (hash.target) {\n    target = handlebarsGet(this, hash.target, options);\n  } else if (controller = options.data.keywords.controller) {\n    target = get(controller, 'target');\n  }\n\n  action.target = target = target || view;\n\n  if (contexts.length) {\n    action.contexts = contexts = Ember.EnumerableUtils.map(contexts, function(context) {\n      return handlebarsGet(this, context, options);\n    }, this);\n    action.context = contexts[0];\n  }\n\n  var output = [], url;\n\n  if (hash.href && target.urlForEvent) {\n    url = target.urlForEvent.apply(target, [actionName].concat(contexts));\n    output.push('href=\"' + url + '\"');\n    action.link = true;\n  }\n\n  var actionId = ActionHelper.registerAction(actionName, action);\n  output.push('data-ember-action=\"' + actionId + '\"');\n\n  return new EmberHandlebars.SafeString(output.join(\" \"));\n});\n\n})();\n//@ sourceURL=ember-handlebars/helpers/action");minispade.register('ember-handlebars/helpers/binding', "(function() {minispade.require('ember-handlebars/ext');\nminispade.require('ember-handlebars/views/handlebars_bound_view');\nminispade.require('ember-handlebars/views/metamorph_view');\n\n/**\n@module ember\n@submodule ember-handlebars\n*/\n\nvar get = Ember.get, set = Ember.set, fmt = Ember.String.fmt;\nvar handlebarsGet = Ember.Handlebars.get, normalizePath = Ember.Handlebars.normalizePath;\nvar forEach = Ember.ArrayPolyfills.forEach;\n\nvar EmberHandlebars = Ember.Handlebars, helpers = EmberHandlebars.helpers;\n\n// Binds a property into the DOM.

Each view will have its own\n  `content` property set to the appropriate item in the collection.\n\n  The provided block will be applied as the template for each item's view.\n\n  Given an empty `<body>` the following template:\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type=\"text/x-handlebars\">\n    {{#collection contentBinding=\"App.items\"}}\n      Hi {{view.content.name}}\n    {{/collection}}\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  And the following application code\n\n  ``` javascript\n  App = Ember.Application.create()\n  App.items = [\n    Ember.Object.create({name: 'Dave'}),\n    Ember.Object.create({name: 'Mary'}),\n    Ember.Object.create({name: 'Sara'})\n  ]\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the HTML structure below\n\n  ``` html\n  <div class=\"ember-view\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Hi Dave</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Hi Mary</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Hi Sara</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  ### Blockless Use\n  If you provide an `itemViewClass` option that has its own `template` you can omit\n  the block.\n\n  The following template:\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type=\"text/x-handlebars\">\n    {{collection contentBinding=\"App.items\" itemViewClass=\"App.AnItemView\"}}\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  And application code\n\n  ``` javascript\n  App = Ember.Application.create();\n  App.items = [\n    Ember.Object.create({name: 'Dave'}),\n    Ember.Object.create({name: 'Mary'}),\n    Ember.Object.create({name: 'Sara'})\n  ];\n\n  App.AnItemView = Ember.View.extend({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"Greetings {{view.content.name}}\")\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the HTML structure below\n\n  ``` html\n  <div class=\"ember-view\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Greetings Dave</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Greetings Mary</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Greetings Sara</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  ### Specifying a CollectionView subclass\n\n  By default the `{{collection}}` helper will create an instance of `Ember.CollectionView`.\n  You can supply a `Ember.CollectionView` subclass to the helper by passing it\n  as the first argument:\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type=\"text/x-handlebars\">\n    {{#collection App.MyCustomCollectionClass contentBinding=\"App.items\"}}\n      Hi {{view.content.name}}\n    {{/collection}}\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n\n  ### Forwarded `item.*`-named Options\n\n  As with the `{{view}}`, helper options passed to the `{{collection}}` will be set on\n  the resulting `Ember.CollectionView` as properties. Additionally, options prefixed with\n  `item` will be applied to the views rendered for each item (note the camelcasing):\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type=\"text/x-handlebars\">\n    {{#collection contentBinding=\"App.items\"\n                  itemTagName=\"p\"\n                  itemClassNames=\"greeting\"}}\n      Howdy {{view.content.name}}\n    {{/collection}}\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the following HTML structure:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div class=\"ember-view\">\n    <p class=\"ember-view greeting\">Howdy Dave</p>\n    <p class=\"ember-view greeting\">Howdy Mary</p>\n    <p class=\"ember-view greeting\">Howdy Sara</p>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  @method collection\n  @for Ember.Handlebars.helpers\n  @param {String} path\n  @param {Hash} options\n  @return {String} HTML string\n  @deprecated Use `{{each}}` helper instead.\n*/\nEmber.Handlebars.registerHelper('collection', function(path, options) {\n  Ember.deprecate(\"Using the {{collection}} helper without specifying a class has been deprecated as the {{each}} helper now supports the same functionality.\", path !== 'collection');\n\n  // If no path is provided, treat path param as options.\n  if (path && path.data && path.data.isRenderData) {\n    options = path;\n    path = undefined;\n    Ember.assert(\"You cannot pass more than one argument to the collection helper\", arguments.length === 1);\n  } else {\n    Ember.assert(\"You cannot pass more than one argument to the collection helper\", arguments.length === 2);\n  }\n\n  var fn = options.fn;\n  var data = options.data;\n  var inverse = options.inverse;\n\n  // If passed a path string, convert that into an object.\n  // Otherwise, just default to the standard class.\n  var collectionClass;\n  collectionClass = path ?

Ember will search for the view class\n  starting at the `Ember.View` of the template where `{{view}}` was used as the root object:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  MyApp = Ember.Application.create({});\n  MyApp.OuterView = Ember.View.extend({\n    innerViewClass: Ember.View.extend({\n      classNames: ['a-custom-view-class-as-property']\n    }),\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('{{#view \"innerViewClass\"}} hi {{/view}}')\n  });\n\n  MyApp.OuterView.create().appendTo('body');\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the following HTML:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">\n    <div id=\"ember2\" class=\"ember-view a-custom-view-class-as-property\"> \n      hi\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  ### Blockless use\n\n  If you supply a custom `Ember.View` subclass that specifies its own template\n  or provide a `templateName` option to `{{view}}` it can be used without supplying a block.\n  Attempts to use both a `templateName` option and supply a block will throw an error.\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type=\"text/x-handlebars\">\n    {{view \"MyApp.ViewWithATemplateDefined\"}}\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  ### viewName property\n\n  You can supply a `viewName` option to `{{view}}`. The `Ember.View` instance will\n  be referenced as a property of its parent view by this name.\n\n  ``` javascript\n  aView = Ember.View.create({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('{{#view viewName=\"aChildByName\"}} hi {{/view}}')\n  });\n\n  aView.appendTo('body');\n  aView.get('aChildByName') // the instance of Ember.View created by {{view}} helper\n  ```\n\n  @method view\n  @for Ember.Handlebars.helpers\n  @param {String} path\n  @param {Hash} options\n  @return {String} HTML string\n*/\nEmberHandlebars.registerHelper('view', function(path, options) {\n  Ember.assert(\"The view helper only takes a single argument\", arguments.length <= 2);\n\n  // If no path is provided, treat path param as options.\n  if (path && path.data && path.data.isRenderData) {\n    options = path;\n    path = \"Ember.View\";\n  }\n\n  return EmberHandlebars.ViewHelper.helper(this, path, options);\n});\n\n\n})();\n//@ sourceURL=ember-handlebars/helpers/view");minispade.register('ember-handlebars/helpers/yield', "(function() {/**\n@module ember\n@submodule ember-handlebars\n*/\n\nvar get = Ember.get, set = Ember.set;\n\n/**\n\n  When used in a Handlebars template that is assigned to an `Ember.View` instance's\n  `layout` property Ember will render the layout template first, inserting the view's\n  own rendered output at the `{{ yield }}` location.\n\n  An empty `<body>` and the following application code:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNames: ['a-view-with-layout'],\n    layout: Ember.Handlebars.compile('<div class=\"wrapper\">{{ yield }}</div>'),\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('<span>I am wrapped</span>')\n  });\n\n  aView = AView.create();\n  aView.appendTo('body');\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the following HTML output:\n\n  ``` html\n  <body>\n    <div class='ember-view a-view-with-layout'>\n      <div class=\"wrapper\">\n        <span>I am wrapped</span>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n  ```\n\n  The yield helper cannot be used outside of a template assigned to an `Ember.View`'s `layout` property\n  and will throw an error if attempted.\n\n  ``` javascript\n  BView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNames: ['a-view-with-layout'],\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('{{yield}}')\n  });\n\n  bView = BView.create();\n  bView.appendTo('body');\n\n  // throws\n  // Uncaught Error: assertion failed: You called yield in a template that was not a layout\n  ```\n\n  @method yield\n  @for Ember.Handlebars.helpers\n  @param {Hash} options\n  @return {String} HTML string\n*/\nEmber.Handlebars.registerHelper('yield', function(options) {\n  var view = options.data.view, template;\n\n  while (view && !get(view, 'layout')) {\n    view = get(view, 'parentView');\n  }\n\n  Ember.assert(\"You called yield in a template that was not a layout\", !!view);\n\n  template = get(view, 'template');\n\n  if (template) { template(this, options); }\n});\n\n})();\n//@ sourceURL=ember-handlebars/helpers/yield");minispade.register('ember-handlebars/loader', "(function() {/*globals Handlebars */\nminispade.require(\"ember-handlebars/ext\");\n\n/**\n@module ember\n@submodule ember-handlebars\n*/\n\n/**\n  @private\n\n  Find templates stored in the head tag as script tags and make them available\n  to Ember.CoreView in the global Ember.TEMPLATES object.

Now the two values will be\n  kept in sync.\n\n  ## One Way Bindings\n\n  One especially useful binding customization you can use is the `oneWay()`\n  helper. This helper tells Ember that you are only interested in\n  receiving changes on the object you are binding from. For example, if you\n  are binding to a preference and you want to be notified if the preference\n  has changed, but your object will not be changing the preference itself, you\n  could do:\n\n      bigTitlesBinding: Ember.Binding.oneWay(\"MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles\")\n\n  This way if the value of MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles changes the\n  \"bigTitles\" property of your object will change also. However, if you\n  change the value of your \"bigTitles\" property, it will not update the\n  preferencesController.\n\n  One way bindings are almost twice as fast to setup and twice as fast to\n  execute because the binding only has to worry about changes to one side.\n\n  You should consider using one way bindings anytime you have an object that\n  may be created frequently and you do not intend to change a property; only\n  to monitor it for changes. (such as in the example above).\n\n  ## Adding Bindings Manually\n\n  All of the examples above show you how to configure a custom binding, but\n  the result of these customizations will be a binding template, not a fully\n  active Binding instance. The binding will actually become active only when you\n  instantiate the object the binding belongs to. It is useful however, to\n  understand what actually happens when the binding is activated.\n\n  For a binding to function it must have at least a \"from\" property and a \"to\"\n  property. The from property path points to the object/key that you want to\n  bind from while the to path points to the object/key you want to bind to.\n\n  When you define a custom binding, you are usually describing the property\n  you want to bind from (such as \"MyApp.someController.value\" in the examples\n  above). When your object is created, it will automatically assign the value\n  you want to bind \"to\" based on the name of your binding key. In the\n  examples above, during init, Ember objects will effectively call\n  something like this on your binding:\n\n      binding = Ember.Binding.from(this.valueBinding).to(\"value\");\n\n  This creates a new binding instance based on the template you provide, and\n  sets the to path to the \"value\" property of the new object. Now that the\n  binding is fully configured with a \"from\" and a \"to\", it simply needs to be\n  connected to become active. This is done through the connect() method:\n\n      binding.connect(this);\n\n  Note that when you connect a binding you pass the object you want it to be\n  connected to.  This object will be used as the root for both the from and\n  to side of the binding when inspecting relative paths.  This allows the\n  binding to be automatically inherited by subclassed objects as well.\n\n  Now that the binding is connected, it will observe both the from and to side\n  and relay changes.\n\n  If you ever needed to do so (you almost never will, but it is useful to\n  understand this anyway), you could manually create an active binding by\n  using the Ember.bind() helper method. (This is the same method used by\n  to setup your bindings on objects):\n\n      Ember.bind(MyApp.anotherObject, \"value\", \"MyApp.someController.value\");\n\n  Both of these code fragments have the same effect as doing the most friendly\n  form of binding creation like so:\n\n      MyApp.anotherObject = Ember.Object.create({\n        valueBinding: \"MyApp.someController.value\",\n\n        // OTHER CODE FOR THIS OBJECT...\n\n      });\n\n  Ember's built in binding creation method makes it easy to automatically\n  create bindings for you. You should always use the highest-level APIs\n  available, even if you understand how it works underneath.\n\n  @class Binding\n  @namespace Ember\n  @since Ember 0.9\n*/\nEmber.Binding = Binding;\n\n\n/**\n  Global helper method to create a new binding.

The `Ember.Router` instance of an application detects the browser URL\n  at application load time and attempts to match it to a specific application state. Additionally\n  the router will update the URL to reflect an application's state changes over time.\n\n  ## Adding a Router Instance to Your Application\n  An instance of Ember.Router can be associated with an instance of Ember.Application in one of two ways:\n\n  You can provide a subclass of Ember.Router as the `Router` property of your application. An instance\n  of this Router class will be instantiated and route detection will be enabled when the application's\n  `initialize` method is called. The Router instance will be available as the `router` property\n  of the application:\n\n      App = Ember.Application.create({\n        Router: Ember.Router.extend({ ... })\n      });\n\n      App.initialize();\n      App.get('router') // an instance of App.Router\n\n  If you want to define a Router instance elsewhere, you can pass the instance to the application's\n  `initialize` method:\n\n      App = Ember.Application.create();\n      aRouter = Ember.Router.create({ ... });\n\n      App.initialize(aRouter);\n      App.get('router') // aRouter\n\n  ## Adding Routes to a Router\n  The `initialState` property of Ember.Router instances is named `root`. The state stored in this\n  property must be a subclass of Ember.Route. The `root` route acts as the container for the\n  set of routable states but is not routable itself. It should have states that are also subclasses\n  of Ember.Route which each have a `route` property describing the URL pattern you would like to detect.\n\n      App = Ember.Application.create({\n        Router: Ember.Router.extend({\n          root: Ember.Route.extend({\n            index: Ember.Route.extend({\n              route: '/'\n            }),\n            ... additional Ember.Routes ...\n          })\n        })\n      });\n      App.initialize();\n\n\n  When an application loads, Ember will parse the URL and attempt to find an Ember.Route within\n  the application's states that matches. (The example URL-matching below will use the default\n  'hash syntax' provided by `Ember.HashLocation`.)\n\n  In the following route structure:\n\n      App = Ember.Application.create({\n        Router: Ember.Router.extend({\n          root: Ember.Route.extend({\n            aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n              route: '/'\n            }),\n            bRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n              route: '/alphabeta'\n            })\n          })\n        })\n      });\n      App.initialize();\n\n  Loading the page at the URL '#/' will detect the route property of 'root.aRoute' ('/') and\n  transition the router first to the state named 'root' and then to the substate 'aRoute'.\n\n  Respectively, loading the page at the URL '#/alphabeta' would detect the route property of\n  'root.bRoute' ('/alphabeta') and transition the router first to the state named 'root' and\n  then to the substate 'bRoute'.\n\n  ## Adding Nested Routes to a Router\n  Routes can contain nested subroutes each with their own `route` property describing the nested\n  portion of the URL they would like to detect and handle. Router, like all instances of StateManager,\n  cannot call `transitonTo` with an intermediary state. To avoid transitioning the Router into an\n  intermediary state when detecting URLs, a Route with nested routes must define both a base `route`\n  property for itself and a child Route with a `route` property of `'/'` which will be transitioned\n  to when the base route is detected in the URL:\n\n  Given the following application code:\n\n      App = Ember.Application.create({\n        Router: Ember.Router.extend({\n          root: Ember.Route.extend({\n            aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n              route: '/theBaseRouteForThisSet',\n\n              indexSubRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n                route: '/'\n              }),\n\n              subRouteOne: Ember.Route.extend({\n                route: '/subroute1'\n              }),\n\n              subRouteTwo: Ember.Route.extend({\n                route: '/subRoute2'\n              })\n\n            })\n          })\n        })\n      });\n      App.initialize();\n\n  When the application is loaded at '/theBaseRouteForThisSet' the Router will transition to the route\n  at path 'root.aRoute' and then transition to state 'indexSubRoute'.\n\n  When the application is loaded at '/theBaseRouteForThisSet/subRoute1' the Router will transition to\n  the route at path 'root.aRoute' and then transition to state 'subRouteOne'.\n\n  ## Route Transition Events\n  Transitioning between Ember.Route instances (including the transition into the detected\n  route when loading the application)  triggers the same transition events as state transitions for\n  base `Ember.State`s. However, the default `setup` transition event is named `connectOutlets` on\n  Ember.Router instances (see 'Changing View Hierarchy in Response To State Change').\n\n  The following route structure when loaded with the URL \"#/\"\n\n      App = Ember.Application.create({\n        Router: Ember.Router.extend({\n          root: Ember.Route.extend({\n            aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n              route: '/',\n              enter: function(router) {\n                console.log(\"entering root.aRoute from\", router.get('currentState.name'));\n              },\n              connectOutlets: function(router) {\n                console.log(\"entered root.aRoute, fully transitioned to\", router.get('currentState.path'));\n              }\n            })\n          })\n        })\n      });\n      App.initialize();\n\n  Will result in console output of:\n\n      'entering root.aRoute from root'\n      'entered root.aRoute, fully transitioned to root.aRoute '\n\n  Ember.Route has two additional callbacks for handling URL serialization and deserialization. See\n  'Serializing/Deserializing URLs'\n\n  ## Routes With Dynamic Segments\n  An Ember.Route's `route` property can reference dynamic sections of the URL by prefacing a URL segment\n  with the ':' character.  The values of these dynamic segments will be passed as a hash to the\n  `deserialize` method of the matching Route (see 'Serializing/Deserializing URLs').\n\n  ## Serializing/Deserializing URLs\n  Ember.Route has two callbacks for associating a particular object context with a URL: `serialize`\n  for converting an object into a parameters hash to fill dynamic segments of a URL and `deserialize`\n  for converting a hash of dynamic segments from the URL into the appropriate object.\n\n  ### Deserializing A URL's Dynamic Segments\n  When an application is first loaded or the URL is changed manually (e.g. through the browser's\n  back button) the `deserialize` method of the URL's matching Ember.Route will be called with\n  the application's router as its first argument and a hash of the URL's dynamic segments and values\n  as its second argument.\n\n  The following route structure when loaded with the URL \"#/fixed/thefirstvalue/anotherFixed/thesecondvalue\":\n\n      App = Ember.Application.create({\n        Router: Ember.Router.extend({\n          root: Ember.Route.extend({\n            aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n              route: '/fixed/:dynamicSectionA/anotherFixed/:dynamicSectionB',\n              deserialize: function(router, params) {}\n            })\n          })\n        })\n      });\n      App.initialize();\n\n  Will call the 'deserialize' method of the Route instance at the path 'root.aRoute' with the\n  following hash as its second argument:\n\n      {\n        dynamicSectionA: 'thefirstvalue',\n        dynamicSectionB: 'thesecondvalue'\n      }\n\n  Within `deserialize` you should use this information to retrieve or create an appropriate context\n  object for the given URL (e.g. by loading from a remote API or accessing the browser's\n  `localStorage`). This object must be the `return` value of `deserialize` and will be\n  passed to the Route's `connectOutlets` and `serialize` methods.\n\n  When an application's state is changed from within the application itself, the context provided for\n  the transition will be passed and `deserialize` is not called (see 'Transitions Between States').\n\n  ### Serializing An Object For URLs with Dynamic Segments\n  When transitioning into a Route whose `route` property contains dynamic segments the Route's\n  `serialize` method is called with the Route's router as the first argument and the Route's\n  context as the second argument.  The return value of `serialize` will be used to populate the\n  dynamic segments and should be an object with keys that match the names of the dynamic sections.\n\n  Given the following route structure:\n\n      App = Ember.Application.create({\n        Router: Ember.Router.extend({\n          root: Ember.Route.extend({\n            aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n              route: '/'\n            }),\n            bRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n              route: '/staticSection/:someDynamicSegment',\n              serialize: function(router, context) {\n                return {\n                  someDynamicSegment: context.get('name')\n                }\n              }\n            })\n          })\n        })\n      });\n      App.initialize();\n\n\n  Transitioning to \"root.bRoute\" with a context of `Object.create({name: 'Yehuda'})` will call\n  the Route's `serialize` method with the context as its second argument and update the URL to\n  '#/staticSection/Yehuda'.\n\n  ## Transitions Between States\n  Once a routed application has initialized its state based on the entry URL, subsequent transitions to other\n  states will update the URL if the entered Route has a `route` property. Given the following route structure\n  loaded at the URL '#/':\n\n      App = Ember.Application.create({\n        Router: Ember.Router.extend({\n          root: Ember.Route.extend({\n            aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n              route: '/',\n              moveElsewhere: Ember.Route.transitionTo('bRoute')\n            }),\n            bRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n              route: '/someOtherLocation'\n            })\n          })\n        })\n      });\n      App.initialize();\n\n  And application code:\n\n      App.get('router').send('moveElsewhere');\n\n  Will transition the application's state to 'root.bRoute' and trigger an update of the URL to\n  '#/someOtherLocation'.\n\n  For URL patterns with dynamic segments a context can be supplied as the second argument to `send`.\n  The router will match dynamic segments names to keys on this object and fill in the URL with the\n  supplied values. Given the following state structure loaded at the URL '#/':\n\n      App = Ember.Application.create({\n        Router: Ember.Router.extend({\n          root: Ember.Route.extend({\n            aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n              route: '/',\n              moveElsewhere: Ember.Route.transitionTo('bRoute')\n            }),\n            bRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n              route: '/a/route/:dynamicSection/:anotherDynamicSection',\n              connectOutlets: function(router, context) {},\n            })\n          })\n        })\n      });\n      App.initialize();\n\n  And application code:\n\n      App.get('router').send('moveElsewhere', {\n        dynamicSection: '42',\n        anotherDynamicSection: 'Life'\n      });\n\n  Will transition the application's state to 'root.bRoute' and trigger an update of the URL to\n  '#/a/route/42/Life'.\n\n  The context argument will also be passed as the second argument to the `serialize` method call.\n\n  ## Injection of Controller Singletons\n  During application initialization Ember will detect properties of the application ending in 'Controller',\n  create singleton instances of each class, and assign them as properties on the router.  The property name\n  will be the UpperCamel name converted to lowerCamel format. These controller classes should be subclasses\n  of Ember.ObjectController, Ember.ArrayController, Ember.Controller, or a custom Ember.Object that includes the\n  Ember.ControllerMixin mixin.\n\n  ``` javascript\n  App = Ember.Application.create({\n    FooController: Ember.Object.create(Ember.ControllerMixin),\n    Router: Ember.Router.extend({ ... })\n  });\n\n  App.get('router.fooController'); // instance of App.FooController\n  ```\n\n  The controller singletons will have their `namespace` property set to the application and their `target`\n  property set to the application's router singleton for easy integration with Ember's user event system.\n  See 'Changing View Hierarchy in Response To State Change' and 'Responding to User-initiated Events.'\n\n  ## Responding to User-initiated Events\n  Controller instances injected into the router at application initialization have their `target` property\n  set to the application's router instance. These controllers will also be the default `context` for their\n  associated views.  Uses of the `{{action}}` helper will automatically target the application's router.\n\n  Given the following application entered at the URL '#/':\n\n  ``` javascript\n  App = Ember.Application.create({\n    Router: Ember.Router.extend({\n      root: Ember.Route.extend({\n        aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n          route: '/',\n          anActionOnTheRouter: function(router, context) {\n            router.transitionTo('anotherState', context);\n          }\n        })\n        anotherState: Ember.Route.extend({\n          route: '/differentUrl',\n          connectOutlets: function(router, context) {\n\n          }\n        })\n      })\n    })\n  });\n  App.initialize();\n  ```\n\n  The following template:\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type=\"text/x-handlebars\" data-template-name=\"aView\">\n      <h1><a {{action anActionOnTheRouter}}>{{title}}</a></h1>\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  Will delegate `click` events on the rendered `h1` to the application's router instance. In this case the\n  `anActionOnTheRouter` method of the state at 'root.aRoute' will be called with the view's controller\n  as the context argument. This context will be passed to the `connectOutlets` as its second argument.\n\n  Different `context` can be supplied from within the `{{action}}` helper, allowing specific context passing\n  between application states:\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type=\"text/x-handlebars\" data-template-name=\"photos\">\n    {{#each photo in controller}}\n      <h1><a {{action showPhoto photo}}>{{title}}</a></h1>\n    {{/each}}\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  See `Handlebars.helpers.action` for additional usage examples.\n\n\n  ## Changing View Hierarchy in Response To State Change\n\n  Changes in application state that change the URL should be accompanied by associated changes in view\n  hierarchy.  This can be accomplished by calling 'connectOutlet' on the injected controller singletons from\n  within the 'connectOutlets' event of an Ember.Route:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  App = Ember.Application.create({\n    OneController: Ember.ObjectController.extend(),\n    OneView: Ember.View.extend(),\n\n    AnotherController: Ember.ObjectController.extend(),\n    AnotherView: Ember.View.extend(),\n\n    Router: Ember.Router.extend({\n      root: Ember.Route.extend({\n        aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({\n          route: '/',\n          connectOutlets: function(router, context) {\n            router.get('oneController').connectOutlet('another');\n          },\n        })\n      })\n    })\n  });\n  App.initialize();\n  ```\n\n\n  This will detect the '{{outlet}}' portion of `oneController`'s view (an instance of `App.OneView`) and\n  fill it with a rendered instance of `App.AnotherView` whose `context` will be the single instance of\n  `App.AnotherController` stored on the router in the `anotherController` property.\n\n  For more information about Outlets, see `Ember.Handlebars.helpers.outlet`. For additional information on\n  the `connectOutlet` method, see `Ember.Controller.connectOutlet`. For more information on\n  controller injections, see `Ember.Application#initialize()`. For additional information about view context,\n  see `Ember.View`.\n\n  @class Router\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.StateManager\n*/\nEmber.Router = Ember.StateManager.extend(\n/** @scope Ember.Router.prototype */ {\n\n  /**\n    @property initialState\n    @type String\n    @default 'root'\n  */\n  initialState: 'root',\n\n  /**\n    The `Ember.Location` implementation to be used to manage the application\n    URL state.

Create an Ember.ArrayController and set its `content` property:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  MyApp.listController = Ember.ArrayController.create();\n\n  $.get('people.json', function(data) {\n    MyApp.listController.set('content', data);\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Then, create a view that binds to your new controller:\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  {{#each MyApp.listController}}\n    {{firstName}} {{lastName}}\n  {{/each}}\n  ```\n\n  Although you are binding to the controller, the behavior of this controller\n  is to pass through any methods or properties to the underlying array.

You must have a length property.  This property should change whenever\n     the number of items in your enumerable object changes.  If you using this\n     with an Ember.Object subclass, you should be sure to change the length\n     property using set().\n\n  2. If you must implement nextObject().  See documentation.\n\n  Once you have these two methods implement, apply the Ember.Enumerable mixin\n  to your class and you will be able to enumerate the contents of your object\n  like any other collection.\n\n  ## Using Ember Enumeration with Other Libraries\n\n  Many other libraries provide some kind of iterator or enumeration like\n  facility.  This is often where the most common API conflicts occur.\n  Ember's API is designed to be as friendly as possible with other\n  libraries by implementing only methods that mostly correspond to the\n  JavaScript 1.8 API.\n\n  @class Enumerable\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.Mixin\n  @since Ember 0.9\n*/\nEmber.Enumerable = Ember.Mixin.create(\n  /** @scope Ember.Enumerable.prototype */ {\n\n  // compatibility\n  isEnumerable: true,\n\n  /**\n    Implement this method to make your class enumerable.\n\n    This method will be call repeatedly during enumeration.

This is a useful way to\n    manage iteration if you are tracing a linked list, for example.\n\n    Finally the context parameter will always contain a hash you can use as\n    a \"scratchpad\" to maintain any other state you need in order to iterate\n    properly.

This is one of the fundamental ways that\n  models, controllers and views communicate with each other in an Ember\n  application.\n\n  Any object that has this mixin applied can be used in observer\n  operations. That includes Ember.Object and most objects you will\n  interact with as you write your Ember application.\n\n  Note that you will not generally apply this mixin to classes yourself,\n  but you will use the features provided by this module frequently, so it\n  is important to understand how to use it.\n\n  ## Using get() and set()\n\n  Because of Ember's support for bindings and observers, you will always\n  access properties using the get method, and set properties using the\n  set method. This allows the observing objects to be notified and\n  computed properties to be handled properly.\n\n  More documentation about `get` and `set` are below.\n\n  ## Observing Property Changes\n\n  You typically observe property changes simply by adding the `observes`\n  call to the end of your method declarations in classes that you write.\n  For example:\n\n      Ember.Object.create({\n        valueObserver: function() {\n          // Executes whenever the \"value\" property changes\n        }.observes('value')\n      });\n\n  Although this is the most common way to add an observer, this capability\n  is actually built into the Ember.Object class on top of two methods\n  defined in this mixin: `addObserver` and `removeObserver`. You can use\n  these two methods to add and remove observers yourself if you need to\n  do so at runtime.\n\n  To add an observer for a property, call:\n\n      object.addObserver('propertyKey', targetObject, targetAction)\n\n  This will call the `targetAction` method on the `targetObject` to be called\n  whenever the value of the `propertyKey` changes.\n\n  Note that if `propertyKey` is a computed property, the observer will be\n  called when any of the property dependencies are changed, even if the\n  resulting value of the computed property is unchanged. This is necessary\n  because computed properties are not computed until `get` is called.\n\n  @class Observable\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.Mixin\n*/\nEmber.Observable = Ember.Mixin.create(/** @scope Ember.Observable.prototype */ {\n\n  // compatibility\n  isObserverable: true,\n\n  /**\n    Retrieves the value of a property from the object.\n\n    This method is usually similar to using object[keyName] or object.keyName,\n    however it supports both computed properties and the unknownProperty\n    handler.\n\n    Because `get` unifies the syntax for accessing all these kinds\n    of properties, it can make many refactorings easier, such as replacing a\n    simple property with a computed property, or vice versa.\n\n    ### Computed Properties\n\n    Computed properties are methods defined with the `property` modifier\n    declared at the end, such as:\n\n          fullName: function() {\n            return this.getEach('firstName', 'lastName').compact().join(' ');\n          }.property('firstName', 'lastName')\n\n    When you call `get` on a computed property, the function will be\n    called and the return value will be returned instead of the function\n    itself.\n\n    ### Unknown Properties\n\n    Likewise, if you try to call `get` on a property whose value is\n    undefined, the unknownProperty() method will be called on the object.\n    If this method returns any value other than undefined, it will be returned\n    instead.

This is useful for those times when you need to\n    implement a property that is composed of one or more member\n    properties.\n\n    ### Unknown Properties\n\n    If you try to set a value on a key that is undefined in the target\n    object, then the unknownProperty() handler will be called instead. This\n    gives you an opportunity to implement complex \"virtual\" properties that\n    are not predefined on the object. If unknownProperty() returns\n    undefined, then set() will simply set the value on the object.\n\n    ### Property Observers\n\n    In addition to changing the property, set() will also register a\n    property change with the object. Unless you have placed this call\n    inside of a beginPropertyChanges() and endPropertyChanges(), any \"local\"\n    observers (i.e. observer methods declared on the same object), will be\n    called immediately. Any \"remote\" observers (i.e. observer methods\n    declared on another object) will be placed in a queue and called at a\n    later time in a coalesced manner.\n\n    ### Chaining\n\n    In addition to property changes, set() returns the value of the object\n    itself so you can do chaining like this:\n\n          record.set('firstName', 'Charles').set('lastName', 'Jolley');\n\n    @method set\n    @param {String} key The property to set\n    @param {Object} value The value to set or null.\n    @return {Ember.Observable}\n  */\n  set: function(keyName, value) {\n    set(this, keyName, value);\n    return this;\n  },\n\n  /**\n    To set multiple properties at once, call setProperties\n    with a Hash:\n\n          record.setProperties({ firstName: 'Charles', lastName: 'Jolley' });\n\n    @method setProperties\n    @param {Hash} hash the hash of keys and values to set\n    @return {Ember.Observable}\n  */\n  setProperties: function(hash) {\n    return Ember.setProperties(this, hash);\n  },\n\n  /**\n    Begins a grouping of property changes.\n\n    You can use this method to group property changes so that notifications\n    will not be sent until the changes are finished.

You\n  can also iterate through a set just like an array, even accessing objects\n  by index, however there is no guarantee as to their order.\n\n  All Sets are observable via the Enumerable Observer API - which works\n  on any enumerable object including both Sets and Arrays.\n\n  ## Creating a Set\n\n  You can create a set like you would most objects using\n  `new Ember.Set()`.  Most new sets you create will be empty, but you can\n  also initialize the set with some content by passing an array or other\n  enumerable of objects to the constructor.\n\n  Finally, you can pass in an existing set and the set will be copied. You\n  can also create a copy of a set by calling `Ember.Set#copy()`.\n\n      #js\n      // creates a new empty set\n      var foundNames = new Ember.Set();\n\n      // creates a set with four names in it.\n      var names = new Ember.Set([\"Charles\", \"Tom\", \"Juan\", \"Alex\"]); // :P\n\n      // creates a copy of the names set.\n      var namesCopy = new Ember.Set(names);\n\n      // same as above.\n      var anotherNamesCopy = names.copy();\n\n  ## Adding/Removing Objects\n\n  You generally add or remove objects from a set using `add()` or\n  `remove()`. You can add any type of object including primitives such as\n  numbers, strings, and booleans.\n\n  Unlike arrays, objects can only exist one time in a set. If you call `add()`\n  on a set with the same object multiple times, the object will only be added\n  once. Likewise, calling `remove()` with the same object multiple times will\n  remove the object the first time and have no effect on future calls until\n  you add the object to the set again.\n\n  NOTE: You cannot add/remove null or undefined to a set. Any attempt to do so\n  will be ignored.\n\n  In addition to add/remove you can also call `push()`/`pop()`. Push behaves\n  just like `add()` but `pop()`, unlike `remove()` will pick an arbitrary\n  object, remove it and return it. This is a good way to use a set as a job\n  queue when you don't care which order the jobs are executed in.\n\n  ## Testing for an Object\n\n  To test for an object's presence in a set you simply call\n  `Ember.Set#contains()`.\n\n  ## Observing changes\n\n  When using `Ember.Set`, you can observe the `\"[]\"` property to be\n  alerted whenever the content changes.  You can also add an enumerable\n  observer to the set to be notified of specific objects that are added and\n  removed from the set.  See `Ember.Enumerable` for more information on\n  enumerables.\n\n  This is often unhelpful. If you are filtering sets of objects, for instance,\n  it is very inefficient to re-filter all of the items each time the set\n  changes. It would be better if you could just adjust the filtered set based\n  on what was changed on the original set. The same issue applies to merging\n  sets, as well.\n\n  ## Other Methods\n\n  `Ember.Set` primary implements other mixin APIs.  For a complete reference\n  on the methods you will use with `Ember.Set`, please consult these mixins.\n  The most useful ones will be `Ember.Enumerable` and\n  `Ember.MutableEnumerable` which implement most of the common iterator\n  methods you are used to on Array.\n\n  Note that you can also use the `Ember.Copyable` and `Ember.Freezable`\n  APIs on `Ember.Set` as well.  Once a set is frozen it can no longer be\n  modified.  The benefit of this is that when you call frozenCopy() on it,\n  Ember will avoid making copies of the set.  This allows you to write\n  code that can know with certainty when the underlying set data will or\n  will not be modified.\n\n  @class Set\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.CoreObject\n  @uses Ember.MutableEnumerable\n  @uses Ember.Copyable\n  @uses Ember.Freezable\n  @since Ember 0.9\n*/\nEmber.Set = Ember.CoreObject.extend(Ember.MutableEnumerable, Ember.Copyable, Ember.Freezable,\n  /** @scope Ember.Set.prototype */ {\n\n  // ..........................................................\n  // IMPLEMENT ENUMERABLE APIS\n  //\n\n  /**\n    This property will change as the number of objects in the set changes.\n\n    @property length\n    @type number\n    @default 0\n  */\n  length: 0,\n\n  /**\n    Clears the set.

A StateManager\n  instance manages a number of properties that are instances of `Ember.State`,\n  tracks the current active state, and triggers callbacks when states have changed.\n\n  ## Defining States\n\n  The states of StateManager can be declared in one of two ways. First, you can define\n  a `states` property that contains all the states:\n\n      managerA = Ember.StateManager.create({\n        states: {\n          stateOne: Ember.State.create(),\n          stateTwo: Ember.State.create()\n        }\n      })\n\n      managerA.get('states')\n      // {\n      //   stateOne: Ember.State.create(),\n      //   stateTwo: Ember.State.create()\n      // }\n\n  You can also add instances of `Ember.State` (or an `Ember.State` subclass) directly as properties\n  of a StateManager. These states will be collected into the `states` property for you.\n\n      managerA = Ember.StateManager.create({\n        stateOne: Ember.State.create(),\n        stateTwo: Ember.State.create()\n      })\n\n      managerA.get('states')\n      // {\n      //   stateOne: Ember.State.create(),\n      //   stateTwo: Ember.State.create()\n      // }\n\n  ## The Initial State\n  When created a StateManager instance will immediately enter into the state\n  defined as its `start` property or the state referenced by name in its\n  `initialState` property:\n\n      managerA = Ember.StateManager.create({\n        start: Ember.State.create({})\n      })\n\n      managerA.get('currentState.name') // 'start'\n\n      managerB = Ember.StateManager.create({\n        initialState: 'beginHere',\n        beginHere: Ember.State.create({})\n      })\n\n      managerB.get('currentState.name') // 'beginHere'\n\n  Because it is a property you may also provide a computed function if you wish to derive\n  an `initialState` programmatically:\n\n      managerC = Ember.StateManager.create({\n        initialState: function(){\n          if (someLogic) {\n            return 'active';\n          } else {\n            return 'passive';\n          }\n        }.property(),\n        active: Ember.State.create({}),\n        passive: Ember.State.create({})\n      })\n\n  ## Moving Between States\n  A StateManager can have any number of Ember.State objects as properties\n  and can have a single one of these states as its current state.\n\n  Calling `transitionTo` transitions between states:\n\n      robotManager = Ember.StateManager.create({\n        initialState: 'poweredDown',\n        poweredDown: Ember.State.create({}),\n        poweredUp: Ember.State.create({})\n      })\n\n      robotManager.get('currentState.name') // 'poweredDown'\n      robotManager.transitionTo('poweredUp')\n      robotManager.get('currentState.name') // 'poweredUp'\n\n  Before transitioning into a new state the existing `currentState` will have its\n  `exit` method called with the StateManager instance as its first argument and\n  an object representing the transition as its second argument.\n\n  After transitioning into a new state the new `currentState` will have its\n  `enter` method called with the StateManager instance as its first argument and\n  an object representing the transition as its second argument.\n\n      robotManager = Ember.StateManager.create({\n        initialState: 'poweredDown',\n        poweredDown: Ember.State.create({\n          exit: function(stateManager){\n            console.log(\"exiting the poweredDown state\")\n          }\n        }),\n        poweredUp: Ember.State.create({\n          enter: function(stateManager){\n            console.log(\"entering the poweredUp state. Destroy all humans.\")\n          }\n        })\n      })\n\n      robotManager.get('currentState.name') // 'poweredDown'\n      robotManager.transitionTo('poweredUp')\n      // will log\n      // 'exiting the poweredDown state'\n      // 'entering the poweredUp state. Destroy all humans.'\n\n\n  Once a StateManager is already in a state, subsequent attempts to enter that state will\n  not trigger enter or exit method calls. Attempts to transition into a state that the\n  manager does not have will result in no changes in the StateManager's current state:\n\n      robotManager = Ember.StateManager.create({\n        initialState: 'poweredDown',\n        poweredDown: Ember.State.create({\n          exit: function(stateManager){\n            console.log(\"exiting the poweredDown state\")\n          }\n        }),\n        poweredUp: Ember.State.create({\n          enter: function(stateManager){\n            console.log(\"entering the poweredUp state. Destroy all humans.\")\n          }\n        })\n      })\n\n      robotManager.get('currentState.name') // 'poweredDown'\n      robotManager.transitionTo('poweredUp')\n      // will log\n      // 'exiting the poweredDown state'\n      // 'entering the poweredUp state.

You can provide\n  a `childViews` property at creation time that contains instance of `Ember.View`:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n    childViews: [Ember.View.create(), Ember.View.create()]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  You can also provide a list of property names whose values are instances of `Ember.View`:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n    childViews: ['aView', 'bView', 'cView'],\n    aView: Ember.View.create(),\n    bView: Ember.View.create()\n    cView: Ember.View.create()\n  });\n  ```\n\n  The two strategies can be combined:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n    childViews: ['aView', Ember.View.create()],\n    aView: Ember.View.create()\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Each child view's rendering will be inserted into the container's rendered HTML in the same\n  order as its position in the `childViews` property.\n\n  ## Adding and Removing Child Views\n  The views in a container's `childViews` array should be added and removed by manipulating\n  the `childViews` property directly.\n\n  To remove a view pass that view into a `removeObject` call on the container's `childViews` property.\n\n  Given an empty `<body>` the following code\n\n  ``` javascript\n  aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n    classNames: ['the-container'],\n    childViews: ['aView', 'bView'],\n    aView: Ember.View.create({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"A\")\n    }),\n    bView: Ember.View.create({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"B\")\n    })\n  });\n\n  aContainer.appendTo('body');\n  ``` \n\n  Results in the HTML\n\n  ``` html\n  <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">A</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">B</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  Removing a view\n\n  ``` javascript\n  aContainer.get('childViews'); // [aContainer.aView, aContainer.bView]\n  aContainer.get('childViews').removeObject(aContainer.get('bView'));\n  aContainer.get('childViews'); // [aContainer.aView]\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the following HTML\n\n  ``` html\n  <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">A</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n\n  Similarly, adding a child view is accomplished by adding `Ember.View` instances to the\n  container's `childViews` property.\n\n  Given an empty `<body>` the following code\n\n  ``` javascript\n  aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n    classNames: ['the-container'],\n    childViews: ['aView', 'bView'],\n    aView: Ember.View.create({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"A\")\n    }),\n    bView: Ember.View.create({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"B\")\n    })\n  });\n\n  aContainer.appendTo('body');\n  ```\n\n  Results in the HTML\n\n  ``` html\n  <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">A</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">B</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  Adding a view\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AnotherViewClass = Ember.View.extend({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"Another view\")\n  });\n\n  aContainer.get('childViews'); // [aContainer.aView, aContainer.bView]\n  aContainer.get('childViews').pushObject(AnotherViewClass.create());\n  aContainer.get('childViews'); // [aContainer.aView, aContainer.bView, <AnotherViewClass instance>]\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the following HTML\n\n  ``` html\n  <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">A</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">B</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Another view</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n\n  Direct manipulation of childViews presence or absence in the DOM via calls to\n  `remove` or `removeFromParent` or calls to a container's `removeChild` may not behave\n  correctly.\n\n  Calling `remove()` on a child view will remove the view's HTML, but it will remain as part of its\n  container's `childView`s property.\n\n  Calling `removeChild()` on the container will remove the passed view instance from the container's\n  `childView`s but keep its HTML within the container's rendered view.\n\n  Calling `removeFromParent()` behaves as expected but should be avoided in favor of direct\n  manipulation of a container's `childViews` property.\n\n  ``` javascript\n  aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n    classNames: ['the-container'],\n    childViews: ['aView', 'bView'],\n    aView: Ember.View.create({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"A\")\n    }),\n    bView: Ember.View.create({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"B\")\n    })\n  });\n\n  aContainer.appendTo('body');\n  ```\n\n  Results in the HTML\n\n  ``` html\n  <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">A</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">B</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  Calling `aContainer.get('aView').removeFromParent()` will result in the following HTML\n\n  ``` html\n  <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">B</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  And the `Ember.View` instance stored in `aContainer.aView` will be removed from `aContainer`'s\n  `childViews` array.\n\n  ## Templates and Layout\n\n  A `template`, `templateName`, `defaultTemplate`, `layout`, `layoutName` or `defaultLayout`\n  property on a container view will not result in the template or layout being rendered.\n  The HTML contents of a `Ember.ContainerView`'s DOM representation will only be the rendered HTML\n  of its child views.\n\n  ## Binding a View to Display\n\n  If you would like to display a single view in your ContainerView, you can set its `currentView`\n  property. When the `currentView` property is set to a view instance, it will be added to the\n  ContainerView's `childViews` array. If the `currentView` property is later changed to a\n  different view, the new view will replace the old view. If `currentView` is set to `null`, the\n  last `currentView` will be removed.\n\n  This functionality is useful for cases where you want to bind the display of a ContainerView to\n  a controller or state manager. For example, you can bind the `currentView` of a container to\n  a controller like this:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  App.appController = Ember.Object.create({\n    view: Ember.View.create({\n      templateName: 'person_template'\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  {{view Ember.ContainerView currentViewBinding=\"App.appController.view\"}}\n  ```\n\n  @class ContainerView\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.View\n*/\n\nEmber.ContainerView = Ember.View.extend({\n\n  init: function() {\n    this._super();\n\n    var childViews = get(this, 'childViews');\n    Ember.defineProperty(this, 'childViews', childViewsProperty);\n\n    var _childViews = this._childViews;\n\n    forEach(childViews, function(viewName, idx) {\n      var view;\n\n      if ('string' === typeof viewName) {\n        view = get(this, viewName);\n        view = this.createChildView(view);\n        set(this, viewName, view);\n      } else {\n        view = this.createChildView(viewName);\n      }\n\n      _childViews[idx] = view;\n    }, this);\n\n    var currentView = get(this, 'currentView');\n    if (currentView) _childViews.push(this.createChildView(currentView));\n\n    // Make the _childViews array observable\n    Ember.A(_childViews);\n\n    // Sets up an array observer on the child views array.

This can be\n  customized by setting the `tagName` property. The following view class:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  ParagraphView = Ember.View.extend({\n    tagName: 'em'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Would result in instances with the following HTML:\n\n  ``` html\n  <em id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></em>\n  ```\n\n  ## HTML `class` Attribute\n  The HTML `class` attribute of a view's tag can be set by providing a `classNames` property\n  that is set to an array of strings:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNames: ['my-class', 'my-other-class']\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view my-class my-other-class\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings` property\n  set to an array of properties names for the view. The return value of these properties\n  will be added as part of the value for the view's `class` attribute. These properties\n  can be computed properties:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['propertyA', 'propertyB'],\n    propertyA: 'from-a',\n    propertyB: function(){\n      if(someLogic){ return 'from-b'; }\n    }.property()\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view from-a from-b\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name itself\n  will be used as the class name if the property is true. The class name will\n  not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.\n\n  ``` javascript\n  MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['hovered'],\n    hovered: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view hovered\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other than the\n  property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the preferred value after\n  a \":\" character when defining the binding:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['awesome:so-very-cool'],\n    awesome: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view so-very-cool\"></div>\n  ```\n\n\n  Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a camelCase-style\n  format will be converted to a dasherized format:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],\n    isUrgent: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view is-urgent\"></div>\n  ```\n\n\n  Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by\n  traversing a path relative to the view itself:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['messages.empty']\n    messages: Ember.Object.create({\n      empty: true\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view empty\"></div>\n  ```\n\n\n  If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and\n  and a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding\n  like this:\n\n  ```\n  // Applies 'enabled' class when isEnabled is true and 'disabled' when isEnabled is false\n  Ember.View.create({\n    classNameBindings: ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled']\n    isEnabled: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view enabled\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML reprensentation looks like this:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false\n  Ember.View.create({\n    classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled']\n    isEnabled: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  When the `isEnabled` property on the view is set to `false`, it will result\n  in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  Updates to the the value of a class name binding will result in automatic update\n  of the  HTML `class` attribute in the view's rendered HTML representation.\n  If the value becomes  `false` or `undefined` the class name will be removed.\n\n  Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties.\n  See `Ember.Object` documentation for more information about concatenated properties.\n\n  ## HTML Attributes\n\n  The HTML attribute section of a view's tag can be set by providing an `attributeBindings`\n  property set to an array of property names on the view. The return value of these properties\n  will be used as the value of the view's HTML associated attribute:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AnchorView = Ember.View.extend({\n    tagName: 'a',\n    attributeBindings: ['href'],\n    href: 'http://google.com'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n  ```\n\n  If the return value of an `attributeBindings` monitored property is a boolean\n  the property will follow HTML's pattern of repeating the attribute's name as\n  its value:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  MyTextInput = Ember.View.extend({\n    tagName: 'input',\n    attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n    disabled: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <input id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" disabled=\"disabled\" />\n  ```\n\n  `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  MyTextInput = Ember.View.extend({\n    tagName: 'input',\n    attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n    disabled: function(){\n      if (someLogic) {\n        return true;\n      } else {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }.property()\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Updates to the the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic update\n  of the  HTML attribute in the view's rendered HTML representation.\n\n  `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See `Ember.Object` documentation\n  for more information about concatenated properties.\n\n  ## Templates\n\n  The HTML contents of a view's rendered representation are determined by its template.\n  Templates can be any function that accepts an optional context parameter and returns\n  a string of HTML that will be inserted within the view's tag. Most\n  typically in Ember this function will be a compiled Ember.Handlebars template.\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('I am the template')\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">I am the template</div>\n  ```\n\n  Within an Ember application is more common to define a Handlebars templates as\n  part of a page:\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  <script type='text/x-handlebars' data-template-name='some-template'>\n    Hello\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  And associate it by name using a view's `templateName` property:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    templateName: 'some-template'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Using a value for `templateName` that does not have a Handlebars template with a\n  matching `data-template-name` attribute will throw an error.\n\n  Assigning a value to both `template` and `templateName` properties will throw an error.\n\n  For views classes that may have a template later defined (e.g. as the block portion of a `{{view}}`\n  Handlebars helper call in another template or in a subclass), you can provide a `defaultTemplate`\n  property set to compiled template function. If a template is not later provided for the view\n  instance the `defaultTemplate` value will be used:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    defaultTemplate: Ember.Handlebars.compile('I was the default'),\n    template: null,\n    templateName: null\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">I was the default</div>\n  ```\n\n  If a `template` or `templateName` is provided it will take precedence over `defaultTemplate`:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    defaultTemplate: Ember.Handlebars.compile('I was the default')\n  });\n\n  aView = AView.create({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('I was the template, not default')\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the following HTML representation when rendered:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">I was the template, not default</div>\n  ```\n\n  ## View Context\n\n  The default context of the compiled template is the view's controller:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('Hello {{excitedGreeting}}')\n  });\n\n  aController = Ember.Object.create({\n    firstName: 'Barry',\n    excitedGreeting: function(){\n      return this.get(\"content.firstName\") + \"!!!\"\n    }.property()\n  });\n\n  aView = AView.create({\n    controller: aController,\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">Hello Barry!!!</div>\n  ```\n\n  A context can also be explicitly supplied through the view's `context` property.\n  If the view has neither `context` nor `controller` properties, the parentView's\n  context will be used.\n\n  ## Layouts\n\n  Views can have a secondary template that wraps their main template. Like\n  primary templates, layouts can be any function that  accepts an optional context\n  parameter and returns a string of HTML that will be inserted inside view's tag. Views whose HTML\n  element is self closing (e.g. `<input />`) cannot have a layout and this property will be ignored.\n\n  Most typically in Ember a layout will be a compiled Ember.Handlebars template.\n\n  A view's layout can be set directly with the `layout` property or reference an\n  existing Handlebars template by name with the `layoutName` property.\n\n  A template used as a layout must contain a single use of the Handlebars `{{yield}}`\n  helper. The HTML contents of a view's rendered `template` will be inserted at this location:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AViewWithLayout = Ember.View.extend({\n    layout: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"<div class='my-decorative-class'>{{yield}}</div>\")\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"I got wrapped\"),\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ``` html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">\n    <div class=\"my-decorative-class\">\n      I got wrapped\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  See `Handlebars.helpers.yield` for more information.\n\n  ## Responding to Browser Events\n\n  Views can respond to user-initiated events in one of three ways: method implementation,\n  through an event manager, and through `{{action}}` helper use in their template or layout.\n\n  ### Method Implementation\n\n  Views can respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method that matches the\n  event name. A `jQuery.Event` object will be passed as the argument to this method.\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    click: function(event){\n      // will be called when when an instance's\n      // rendered element is clicked\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ### Event Managers\n\n  Views can define an object as their `eventManager` property. This object can then\n  implement methods that match the desired event names. Matching events that occur\n  on the view's rendered HTML or the rendered HTML of any of its DOM descendants\n  will trigger this method.  A `jQuery.Event` object will be passed as the first\n  argument to the method and an  `Ember.View` object as the second. The `Ember.View`\n  will be the view whose rendered HTML was interacted with. This may be the view with\n  the `eventManager` property or one of its descendent views.\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    eventManager: Ember.Object.create({\n      doubleClick: function(event, view){\n        // will be called when when an instance's\n        // rendered element or any rendering\n        // of this views's descendent\n        // elements is clicked\n      }\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  An event defined for an event manager takes precedence over events of the same\n  name handled through methods on the view.\n\n  ``` javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    mouseEnter: function(event){\n      // will never trigger.\n    },\n    eventManager: Ember.Object.create({\n      mouseEnter: function(event, view){\n        // takes presedence over AView#mouseEnter\n      }\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Similarly a view's event manager will take precedence for events of any views\n  rendered as a descendent. A method name that matches an event name will not be called\n  if the view instance was rendered inside the HTML representation of a view that has\n  an `eventManager` property defined that handles events of the name.  Events not handled\n  by the event manager will still trigger method calls on the descendent.\n\n  ``` javascript\n  OuterView = Ember.View.extend({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"outer {{#view InnerView}}inner{{/view}} outer\"),\n    eventManager: Ember.Object.create({\n      mouseEnter: function(event, view){\n        // view might be instance of either\n        // OutsideView or InnerView depending on\n        // where on the page the user interaction occured\n      }\n    })\n  });\n\n  InnerView = Ember.View.extend({\n    click: function(event){\n      // will be called if rendered inside\n      // an OuterView because OuterView's\n      // eventManager doesn't handle click events\n    },\n    mouseEnter: function(event){\n      // will never be called if rendered inside\n      // an OuterView.\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ### Handlebars `{{action}}` Helper\n\n  See `Handlebars.helpers.action`.\n\n  ### Event Names\n\n  Possible events names for any of the responding approaches described above are:\n\n  Touch events: 'touchStart', 'touchMove', 'touchEnd', 'touchCancel'\n\n  Keyboard events: 'keyDown', 'keyUp', 'keyPress'\n\n  Mouse events: 'mouseDown', 'mouseUp', 'contextMenu', 'click', 'doubleClick', 'mouseMove',\n  'focusIn', 'focusOut', 'mouseEnter', 'mouseLeave'\n\n  Form events: 'submit', 'change', 'focusIn', 'focusOut', 'input'\n\n  HTML5 drag and drop events: 'dragStart', 'drag', 'dragEnter', 'dragLeave', 'drop', 'dragEnd'\n\n  ## Handlebars `{{view}}` Helper\n\n  Other `Ember.View` instances can be included as part of a view's template by using the `{{view}}`\n  Handlebars helper.
